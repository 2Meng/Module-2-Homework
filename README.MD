This project reflects my first personal portfolio. It introduces the user to my skills as a beginner Front end developer. Is it interactive and has features that the user can explore to learn about me.

It was quite a struggle to make the website look great without much experience but building the website was a fun experience. I think with more practice using CSS will vastly boost the look of the website in the near future..!
